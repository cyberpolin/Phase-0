# Factorial

# I worked on this challenge [with:Alec Hendrickson ].


# Your Solution Below
def factorial(number)
  # Your code goes here
  # Your code goes here
  # Iter from 1 as i to number
  total = 1
  number.times do |x|
    total = total * (x+1)
  end
  p total
    # save the value of i in iter_var
    # multiply iter_var times i
    # sum iter_var times i in to total

  #return total
end
