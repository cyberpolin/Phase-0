- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    > It's really cool to see the info getting in place, i love doing Html
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    > Pretty easy i found http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ and everithing is right there.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    > Well i just don't think about the aesthetics of the web page, just the content, i'll worry later for css :)

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    > I like the idea of just writing content in it, but i think that we need to write so much text to make anything mean something, like it would be easier to just type <p the paragraph/>.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    >just to think that anything can be nested, to respect the indentation, and to keep in mind everything needs to be closed.
