      <p>
        A lot of people arround me think that i'm attending Dev Bootcamp because of the technical skills i will learn there. That is trueth, but thath is not the main reason is i hear in the previos main video on the website something about a holistic programe, and how in Dev Bootcamp help developers to search wellnes in body and mind.

      <p>
        So when i saw this video of Shereef Bishay talking about how we want to take care of our body and mind it make a lot of sense to me
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more to hear about the collaborative ambience we need to create arround our cohort, always trying to enrich it by givin the best we can. In Mexico we have a lot of talented developers, but the main way of thinking is a mediocre one, so we need to change that, and a way to change thinks is to do it yourself, that's why i will give my best and always be open to feedbak and new stuff to learn.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  > The section, it's just a nice way to divide your page into important parts, i definitely will use it in the future while writing blogs.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  > From up to bottom, and from outside to inside tags.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  > I learned how to make snippets and love it, yea i will create more snippets, for example for an img, i will love one it write for me the alt tag. finally i realize that sublime writes for me the opening and closing tag if i write it and press tab key.
