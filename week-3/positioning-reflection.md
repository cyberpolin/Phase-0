# Positioning YEAH!

**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**
- It helps you a lot, because you can see the changes immediately, i suppose it's also a big help to use in live sites.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**
- Just changing the width and weight, also but no neccesary with padding.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**
- Absolute run over the HTML tag, and the position is absolute from that.
- Fixed is like absolute, but in the viewport, it's pretty straight forward.
- Relative is when the object position is relative to the object containing it.
- Static with this one the object will render immediately after the other.

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**
- margin push everything from the border out, padding do it from the border to insite.
-  And border is just that a border of the object.

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**
- I love the fact i could change on the fly something and see the result so fast, and in the other hand i had trouble positioning an element in certain way, i believe i need practice.
