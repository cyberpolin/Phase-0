<!--
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
> the relative path of that css, also is important if your using more than one css to know which one goes first.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
> The inline block was a saver, we also use column count, but finally goes with 2 divs which were displayed as inline-block

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
> sometimes we use the tag, some other a class.(I didn't get the question, so i hope this answer is ok)

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
> we use only classes, and that's because they are more generall than id, i guess id work better for especial occasions.
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
> Jajajaj i'm sure you guys use that site as an example of what you shouldn't do, anyway is obvious that they did all they are styling over html, which is not good at all.
