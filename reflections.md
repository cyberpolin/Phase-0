# My first repository and first changes

## Think About Time
  **Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**

  The most important for me is the time boxing, especifically pomodoro, and the idea of resting every 25 minutes, preventing outside distraction, thath way if you have low focus it will help.

**What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?**
  Is assigning a given time for a given task, that prevents you to burnout, and improve concentration.

**How do you manage your time currently?**
  I was doing something really bad, i did'nt manage my time at all, now i am implementing pomodoro technique.

**Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?**
  No, it isn't working at all, i just start to work and finish whenever i finish, that's pretty bad for the mind, and also as time passes the efficiency of my work go down, so i'm working in not such a good way.

**Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**
  I'll employ both pomodoro management and fogg method, the last one will help me employing the first one

**What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**
  First of all i want to make the meditation habit, so i am meditating 5 minutes every day for a week then 10 minutes for 15 days, then 15 minutes.

  Secondly i will make the habit of time boxing my work periods, then i'll plan my work day in pomodoro units of time, at last as i master that technique, i will meditate 2 minutes between pomodoro time lapse

# The Command Line
  Hi,

loved this module, i already used bash before but not in this way, so it was a very good thing to know.

Any way answering the questions...

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
     Shell is the most basic way to interact with the kernel or the Operating System itself, and bash is a shell version, it was created by Stephen Bourne, which is the coolest last name ever :). Bash stand for Bourne Again Shell.

     I looked around for the meaning of shell and it turns out it only is a referral of a shell in the animal kingdom, nice info to know.



What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
     understanding the use of pipes and redirections | <> but love it too, because they help you a lot for concatenating several commands on the shell, making with that our job easier.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
     Every one, and as i say on the previous question, the hardest ones were pipes and redirections

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
     The most basic ones, they always are the most important commands, without cd, ls, mkdir, and rm everything else would be impossible, those are the most importants, but that doesn't mean they are the most powerful ones

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd

    Print Working Directory

-ls

    List files (stand for LiSt)

-mv

    MoVe a file

-cd

    Change Directory

-../

    Is a way to getting up a directory

-touch

     Creates or change date on a file

-mkdir

     MaKe DIRectory

-less

     Print on screen a file, but present it in pages

-rmdir

     ReMove DIRectory

-rm

     ReMove files

-help

     Thats an argument right? for example $ rm --help

     If you want help you can use man stead


# Forking and Cloning

If you want to create a repo which is a very good idea first of all you have to remember that a repo is intended for a single project, so don't make projects inside project on Git.

So, go on to https://github.com/<your_profile> (Links to an external site.)

Once you're there look for a plus icon over the right upper corner on your screen, just next to your avatar, and click it, a submenu will appear, please choose "New repository"

A new page will load...

besides your user name and avatar it's a input that stand for "repository name" use whatever you feel right, just try to be descriptive about it.

Then you can type a description, which is optional, but i think good to have, so if you want type in a short description.

Right away you can choose whether your repository is going to be public, meaning anyone can see it and "clone" it, or private which as you guess means the oposite.

As a general rule for me the next to options goes the first in blank, and the second one i choose MIT License if my project is public.

And that's all you have your first repository.

Congratulations!
