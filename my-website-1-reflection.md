**Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.**

**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**
- Ok, first of all, think about git hub as a a library, where you want to keep your personal books, or at least copy of them, in that way you can be certain that the important information its safe. In thah way if something happend to your books you always could go to the library (github) and make a copy of them again.

Now what if you are writing a book, but you need help from other writers, or you havr to write chapter one, and others have to do chapter two or three?, so in thah way anyone can work at home and go to the library and add their advance, in that way when you go to githun (library) you can pull the latest changes to the book or project, and you also left the changes you has made. In the same way other writer could ask for your changes, and always have the lastes copy.

What about if somebody want to add a extra chapter to your book? The he could clone it make the new chapter and pull a request from you, the main writer, then you can review that chapter and allow the new chapter or not.

I have to make a confesion to you, we are not talking about a library or books, we are talking about computer file, and do this is pretty easy just go to github, and create a repository.

Once you do that just go to terminal, and clone that repository by typing "git clone <the repository https url>"
Now you have your own copy Congratulations!


**Describe what open source means.**
- It's mostly a way of development, and the main characteristic is that the source code is open, that means any one can see it, usually any Open Source project use a especific license like MIT or Apache.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**
- Is pretty cool and a hippie idea, the nice thing about open source is to get help improving your code, or getting traction on a project, in the other hand, if you have a solution that you think is unique and don't want to share it, Open Source is not for you.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**
- Is a way of stablishing the rules if somebody want to use your code, there are several types of licenses, ones that allow a lot, like adding, editing , using, or even selling. Other kind of license prohinit a lot of stuff.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**
- Using the git flow in general, and i loved the markdown part, i'm struggleing with the git commands, i just need to remember them.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
- Doesn't help me to understad what is git, but help me with te flow we sould use, tought is a more complex flow what they propose is a cool implementation.
